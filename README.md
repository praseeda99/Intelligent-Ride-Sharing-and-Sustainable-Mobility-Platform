## 🚦 Live Traffic View

The driver dashboard includes a **live traffic overlay** powered by the **TomTom Traffic API** (free tier — 2,500 requests/day, **no credit card required**).

### Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Traffic Flow Tiles** | Colour-coded road overlay (🟢 free-flow → 🟡 moderate → 🔴 heavy congestion) |
| **Traffic Incidents** | Real-time markers for accidents 🚨, jams 🚗, road closures ⛔, construction 🚧, weather 🌧️ |
| **Auto-refresh** | Incidents refresh every 60 seconds and on map pan/zoom |
| **Toggle Controls** | Drivers can toggle traffic flow and incidents on/off independently |

### Getting Your Free TomTom API Key

1. Visit [developer.tomtom.com](https://developer.tomtom.com/)
2. Sign up for a **free account** (no credit card required)
3. Create a new app → copy the **API Key**
4. Add it to your `.env` file:  
   ```
   VITE_TOMTOM_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

> **Note:** The traffic view works without the API key — it simply won't show traffic data. All other map features (routing, markers, ETA) remain fully functional.
